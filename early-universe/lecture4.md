Lecture 4
Universe described on large scale by 3 properties
1. Isotropy -> same in all directions
2. Homogenitty -> density same in all places

Ex homogeneous but not isotropic -> Galaxies all have the same density but lie on the same plane
If isotropie to all observers then it is homogenous

3. 

CMB
- until 400,000 after beginning universe filled with plasma -> photons frozen inside matter(velocity 0) -> opaque 
- At 400k -> gas neutral + transparent -> recombination

Hubbleâ€™s Law
Measured in km/(sMpc)
1Pc(parsec) = 3.2616 light years
1/10^10 = 97.8km/s/Mpc

First measured by lemaitre in 1927 575-625 km/s/Mpc
Hubble measured 500 Mpc

Derive Hubble expansion rate
Lp(t) = a(t) Lc
Lp = physical distance (meters)
Lc = coordinate distance (measured in notches)
a(t) = scale factor (meters/notch)

Vp = d/dt Lp(t) 
 => da/dt Lc (by product rule)
 => (1/a) (da/dt) a(t) Lc (multiple and divide by a)
 => (1/a) (da/dt) Lp

Hubble expansion rate 
H(t) = 1/a da/dt

Motion of light rays
X = coordinate in notches
dx/dt = c/a(t) [notches/s]

Synchronising clocks
 - use the Hubble expansion rate, universe is homogeneous so you can sync clocks when expansion rate is a certain value(which is the same for all observers)
- temp of CMB
